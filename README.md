# Mutual-fund-investment-plan-analysis-
Mutual fund investment plan data analysis using Python involves evaluating fund performance, returns, and risk metrics like NAV trends, volatility, and Sharpe ratio. It uses libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize data, helping investors make informed, data-driven long-term decisions.
A mutual fund plan is built by carefully selecting stocks that can help an investor grow their wealth over the long term. Here’s a simple process to create one:

Gather Stock Data: Start by collecting historical stock prices and looking at how they’ve grown over time.

Analyze Performance: Calculate important numbers like Return on Investment (ROI) and check the stock’s volatility (risk). This helps understand how each stock has performed in the past.

Pick the Right Stocks: Select stocks that offer good returns (high ROI) but with lower risk. The goal is to strike a balance between growth and stability.

Estimate Future Value: Finally, calculate how much your regular monthly investments could grow in the future based on the expected returns from these stocks.

Following this approach can help you build a mutual fund plan that supports your long-term financial goals.
